    Welcome to **Fluwy**, an innovative UI App Framework that lets you build enterprise-level applications using human-friendly YML files. Fluwy simplifies development by eliminating the need for complex coding, allowing you to create and deploy applications faster.

    ## Prerequisites

    Before you start, make sure you have:

    - **Node.js** (version 14.x or later)
    - A code editor (e.g., **VS Code**)
    - Basic understanding of **YAML** and **API integration** (optional but helpful)

    ## Installation

    To begin using Fluwy, follow these steps to set up your project:

    ### Option 1: Install Fluwy locally

    You can install Fluwy in your local environment by using npm or yarn:

    ```bash
    npm install fluwy
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn add fluwy
    ```

    ### Option 2: Start with StackBlitz

    You can start right away using this Fluwy app template on StackBlitz. It comes with all dependencies installed and pre-configured for rapid development.

    ## Creating Your First Fluwy App

    Once you have Fluwy set up, it’s time to create your first app.

    1. Define your UI with **YAML** files that describe the structure and components of your app.
    2. Use TailwindCSS settings to customize the design and appearance.
    3. Integrate your backend services by connecting the UI with **API endpoints** or **GraphQL services**.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    ui:
      components:
        - type: button
          label: "Submit"
          onClick: submitForm
    ```

    ## Next Steps

    Now that you’ve got your first app running, explore more features of Fluwy, such as:

    - **Advanced UI Customization** with TailwindCSS
    - **Connecting with Backend APIs** through simple configurations
    - **Extending your App** with custom Svelte components
